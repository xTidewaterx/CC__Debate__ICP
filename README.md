To find truth humans battle intellectually, striving to find the most convincing arguments for what our life and world consist of, this application attempts to serve this battles a battleground where money and pride is handled diligently. Some features are being built now, I kindly ask for your understanding, this project is stull under construction.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

The goal was to create a decentralised, grandiose "pay-per-use", international debate platform aided by AI and hosted on the Web3-technology ICP to allow humans to continue their combat intellectually, online, with money at stake, for us all to come closer to what is true, in an everchanging world where intellect and the ability to tie words together are the new form of warfare, an online, intellectually driven warfare where opinions clash and controversy is rewarded.

The application allows for combatants to communicate in a comment section that goes 3 layers deep, the comment section is always tied to the battle cause, which is todays (last 24 hours) most popular world event/news story, or if the market rewards it: the participants top suggestions for a battle topic, regardless those who rise on top will be those who shake the battlefield the most through controversial takes that garner the most volatility and destruction through its controversial nature.  Money is divided throughout the comment section through various factors such as engagement, likes, replies, total amount of likes, negativity and branches, now where does the money come from? The money comes from the fact that nobody can comment without first rewarding other comments with their like (which also ensures combatants must scan the battlefield to decide who is deserving of their wealth), and likes cost money, thus nobody can comment without first having paid money to the platform, this money then helps the intellectual ecosystem by rewarding the controversy that makes the platform relevant and the opinions hard hitting.

Each comment section is linked to the worlds most popular news story of that day, and every 24 hours that news piece is changed. Every battle must be saved for history and the personal relics that come from it will go into the proud collection of the participants, carefully selected, stamped and sorted into categories so that the unique intellect of individuals is finally taken seriously in a digital environment that allows for a low barrier to entry individually focused intellectual production with limitless possibilities for  the controversial monetarily driven debate.The previous news/battle piece is then saved together with its refined AI-illustration  giving it artistic quality for our war collection together with its 3-layer comment section, all of this is a reflection of our history and our truth seeking species lust for intellectual battle in a chaotic, everchanging world.
